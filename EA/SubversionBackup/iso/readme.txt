The SVN repository (https://inspire-twg.jrc.it/svn/iso/) contains an XMI representation of the ISO/TC 211 Harmonized Model. 
This describes the UML contained in the ISO 19100 series of standards for Geographic Information. 
The harmonized model is maintained by the Harmonized Model Maintenance Group of ISO/TC 211. 
The SVN is provided by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Institute for Environment and Sustainability, Spatial Data Infrastructures Unit. 

The SVN may also be mirrored so you may be looking in one of those.
