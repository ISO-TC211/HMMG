## ISO/TC211 Geographic information/Geomatics 
# The Harmonized Model Maintenance Group

The ISO/TC211 Harmonized Model Management Group (HMMG) maintains this repository for use by the members of the ISO TC 211 community in the assessment and creation of standards. 

See the [HMMG Wiki](https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG/wiki) for information about the Harmonized Model Repository and how to use it, including how to set up an Enterprise Architect project linked to the official subversion repository. 

The models may be downloaded from folders in this repository:
* [EA](https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG/tree/master/EA): Enterprise Architect Projects with The Harmonized Model
* [XMI](https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG/tree/master/XMI): XMI Files for packages in The Harmonized Model

A HTML view of the model can be found for [Conceptual models](http://www.isotc211.org/hmmg/HTML/ConceptualModels/) and [Implementation Models](http://www.isotc211.org/hmmg/HTML/ImplementationModels/).

See also the wiki https://github.com/ISO-TC211/UML-Best-Practices/wiki for best practices on using UML for geographic information.
