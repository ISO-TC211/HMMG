The ISO/TC211 Harmonized Model Management Group (HMMG) maintains this repository for use by the members of the ISO TC 211 community in the assessment and creation of standards. 

See the [HMMG Wiki](https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG/wiki) for information about the Harmonized Model Repository and how to access and use it. 

The models may be downloaded from folders in this repository:
* [EA](https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG/tree/master/EA): Enterprise Architect Projects with The Harmonized Model
* [XMI](https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG/tree/master/XMI): XMI Files for packages in The Harmonized Model

A HTML view of the model can be found at [http://iso.sparxcloud.com](http://iso.sparxcloud.com/index.php).

See also the wiki https://github.com/ISO-TC211/UML-Best-Practices/wiki for best practices on using UML for geographic information.
